/*
 What is the Bridge Pattern?
The Bridge Pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

ðŸš¨ When to Use It?
When you want to avoid a big class explosion due to too many combinations of abstraction and implementation.

When you need to separate what something does from how it does it.

ðŸ”Œ Real-World Analogy: Remote Control and Devices
Imagine:

You have remotes (basic or advanced).

And you have devices (TV, Radio, etc.).

You want:

Any remote to work with any device, without creating classes like BasicTVRemote, AdvancedTVRemote, BasicRadioRemote, etc.
