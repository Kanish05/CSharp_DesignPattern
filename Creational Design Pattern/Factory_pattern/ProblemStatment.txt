You're building a Notification System for a company. Depending on the situation, the system needs to send different types of notifications:

EmailNotification

SMSNotification

PushNotification

You want to encapsulate the creation logic for each type of notification using the Factory Method Pattern, so that the main app doesn't directly instantiate the notification classes.

 Objective:
Define a common interface or abstract class INotification with a method Send(string to, string message).

Create concrete classes for each notification type that implement INotification.

Create an abstract NotificationFactory class with a factory method CreateNotification().

Implement concrete factories: EmailNotificationFactory, SMSNotificationFactory, PushNotificationFactory.

Demonstrate usage in a Main method where the correct factory is chosen and used to send a notification.
