ðŸ›  Problem Statement: Build a Custom PC
You are tasked with building a PC configuration system. Customers can build different types of PCs: Gaming PC, Office PC, or Budget PC. Each PC can have the following configurable parts:

CPU

RAM

Storage

GPU

Power Supply

Operating System

In addition, for each PC build, you must also generate a Setup Manual that describes the configuration in detail.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:
Implement the Builder pattern to allow constructing:

The PC object (the actual hardware)

The PCManual object (descriptive setup info for users)

Create a Builder interface that defines methods to set:

CPU

RAM

Storage

GPU

Power Supply

OS

Create two concrete builders:

PCBuilder â†’ builds the physical PC object.

PCManualBuilder â†’ builds the PCManual object.

Create a Director class with methods to construct:

BuildGamingPC()

BuildOfficePC()

BuildBudgetPC()

The Client code should:

Use the director to build both a PC and its matching Manual

Display the final objects using ToString() for both

ðŸ§ª Bonus (if you want an extra challenge):
Allow optional GPU (for Budget PC)

After building, the PC object should be immutable

Manual should describe each part in detail (e.g., "CPU: Intel i9, suitable for heavy gaming.")
